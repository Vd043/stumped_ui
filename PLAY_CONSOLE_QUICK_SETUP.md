# Play Console – Quick setup (STUMPED)

Use this while you click through **Dashboard → Finish setting up your app**. Fill each section with the below so you can move fast.

## 1. Set privacy policy

- You need a **URL**. Use GitHub Pages:
  1. Push this project (including `privacy_policy.html`) to your GitHub repo (e.g. `stumped_ui`).
  2. In the repo: **Settings → Pages → Source:** Deploy from branch → choose `main` (or `master`) → `/ (root)` or folder with `privacy_policy.html` → Save.
  3. After the page is live (a few minutes), use this URL in Play Console:

**URL to paste in Play Console (Privacy policy):**

```
https://vd043.github.io/stumped_ui/privacy_policy.html
```

*(If the repo name is not `stumped_ui`, replace it in the URL.)*

**Text to use on the page (ready to paste):**

```
